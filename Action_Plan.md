# Project Goals

The focus of this project is weighted towards front-end design, visualization, business intelligence, communication, presentation, usability, and analytics.
Less focus on in depth machine learning, and "more advanced" work.

1. Explore, visualize, and communicate data surrounding the craft beer industry.
2. Deploy a craft beer industry analytics platform using a combination of AWS, Tableau, Dash/Plotly, Flask, and Django.
3. Obtain individual brewery data and provide ad hoc analysis and business intelligence.

## Central Questions

Determine these during research and EDA phases.

## Methods and Concepts

Data Visualization, Business Intelligence, Cloud Services and AutoML, Web Scraping

## Tech Used

Python - pandas, matplotlib
AWS - 

# Current Focus

1. Determine possible data sources in each category.
2. Research current craft beer industry analytics tools.
3. Research craft beer industry data flow and opportunities.

# Next Steps and Notes

## Data Acquisition

Two separate channels:
1. Large scale data collection through public APIs and Web-Scraping.
    * Open Data Sets
    * Public APIs
    * Web-Scraping
2. Proprietary data through relationships with local breweries.
    * Sales, Financial
    * Marketing, Public Interaction
    * Brewing Tech
    * Beer Popularity, Performance, Quality

## Data Storage

Cloud based, relational/SQL focused storage

AWS services - RDS, S3 + Athena

## Data Cleaning and Processing

## Feature Engineering

## Analysis and Visualization

Determine core output medium:
* BI Tools - Tableau, Power BI, etc.
* Python Based BI Tools - Plotly/Dash
* Python Frontend Tools - Django, Flask

## NLP
